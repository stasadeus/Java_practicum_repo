# Transport
This project implements a class hierarchy with inheritance of any transport. 
Also creates interfaces to work with some of them. 
For example, a bus and a trolleybus are representatives of public transport (public transport was implemented as an interface), and a tank and a fighter are military equipment. 
Steam technology is also an example of a good interface!
